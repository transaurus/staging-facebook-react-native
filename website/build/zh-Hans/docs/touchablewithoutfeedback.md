# TouchableWithoutFeedback

tip

If you're looking for a more extensive and future-proof way to handle touch-based input, check out the [Pressable](/zh-Hans/docs/pressable.md) API.

Do not use unless you have a very good reason. All elements that respond to press should have a visual feedback when touched.

`TouchableWithoutFeedback` supports only one child. If you wish to have several child components, wrap them in a View. Importantly, `TouchableWithoutFeedback` works by cloning its child and applying responder props to it. It is therefore required that any intermediary components pass through those props to the underlying React Native component.

## Usage Pattern[​](#usage-pattern "Direct link to Usage Pattern")

tsx

```
function MyComponent(props: MyComponentProps) {
  return (
    <View {...props} style={{flex: 1, backgroundColor: '#fff'}}>
      <Text>My Component</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

<TouchableWithoutFeedback onPress={() => alert('Pressed!')}>
  <MyComponent />
</TouchableWithoutFeedback>;
```
