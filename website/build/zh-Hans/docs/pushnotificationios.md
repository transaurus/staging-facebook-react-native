### Projects with Native Code Only

The following section only applies to projects with native code exposed. If you are using the managed Expo workflow, see the guide on [Notifications](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/) in the Expo documentation for the appropriate alternative.

Handle notifications for your app, including scheduling and permissions.

***

## Getting Started[​](#getting-started "Direct link to Getting Started")

To enable push notifications, [configure your notifications with Apple](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server) and your server-side system.

Then, [enable remote notifications](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/pushing_background_updates_to_your_app#2980038) in your project. This will automatically enable the required settings.

### Enable support for `register` events[​](#enable-support-for-register-events "Direct link to enable-support-for-register-events")

In your `AppDelegate.m`, add:

objectivec

```
#import <React/RCTPushNotificationManager.h>
```

Then implement the following in order to handle remote notification registration events:

objectivec

```
- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)deviceToken
{
 // This will trigger 'register' events on PushNotificationIOS
 [RCTPushNotificationManager didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:deviceToken];
}
- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:(NSError *)error
{
 // This will trigger 'registrationError' events on PushNotificationIOS
 [RCTPushNotificationManager didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:error];
}
```

### Handle notifications[​](#handle-notifications "Direct link to Handle notifications")

You'll need to implement `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate` in your `AppDelegate`:

objectivec

```
#import <UserNotifications/UserNotifications.h>

@interface YourAppDelegate () <UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate>
@end
```

Set the delegate on app launch:

objectivec

```
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
  ...
  UNUserNotificationCenter *center = [UNUserNotificationCenter currentNotificationCenter];
  center.delegate = self;

  return YES;
}
```

#### Foreground notifications[​](#foreground-notifications "Direct link to Foreground notifications")

Implement `userNotificationCenter:willPresentNotification:withCompletionHandler:` to handle notifications that arrive when the app is in the foreground. Use the completionHandler to determine if the notification will be shown to the user and notify `RCTPushNotificationManager` accordingly:

objectivec

```
// Called when a notification is delivered to a foreground app.
- (void)userNotificationCenter:(UNUserNotificationCenter *)center
       willPresentNotification:(UNNotification *)notification
         withCompletionHandler:(void (^)(UNNotificationPresentationOptions options))completionHandler
{
  // This will trigger 'notification' and 'localNotification' events on PushNotificationIOS
  [RCTPushNotificationManager didReceiveNotification:notification];
  // Decide if and how the notification will be shown to the user
  completionHandler(UNNotificationPresentationOptionNone);
}
```

#### Background notifications[​](#background-notifications "Direct link to Background notifications")

Implement `userNotificationCenter:didReceiveNotificationResponse:withCompletionHandler:` to handle when a notification is tapped, typically called for background notifications which the user taps to open the app. However, if you had set foreground notifications to be shown in `userNotificationCenter:willPresentNotification:withCompletionHandler:`, this method will also be invoked on foreground notifications when tapped. In this case, you should only notify `RCTPushNotificationManager` in one of these callbacks.

If the tapped notification resulted in app launch, call `setInitialNotification:`. If the notification was not previously handled by `userNotificationCenter:willPresentNotification:withCompletionHandler:`, call `didReceiveNotification:` as well:

objectivec

```
- (void)  userNotificationCenter:(UNUserNotificationCenter *)center
  didReceiveNotificationResponse:(UNNotificationResponse *)response
           withCompletionHandler:(void (^)(void))completionHandler
{
  // This condition passes if the notification was tapped to launch the app
  if ([response.actionIdentifier isEqualToString:UNNotificationDefaultActionIdentifier]) {
    // Allow the notification to be retrieved on the JS side using getInitialNotification()
    [RCTPushNotificationManager setInitialNotification:response.notification];
  }
  // This will trigger 'notification' and 'localNotification' events on PushNotificationIOS
  [RCTPushNotificationManager didReceiveNotification:response.notification];
  completionHandler();
}
```

***

### `requestPermissions()`[​](#requestpermissions "Direct link to requestpermissions")

tsx

```
static requestPermissions(permissions?: PushNotificationPermissions[]);
```

Requests notification permissions from iOS, prompting the user with a dialog box. By default, this will request all notification permissions, but you can optionally specify which permissions to request. The following permissions are supported:

* `alert`
* `badge`
* `sound`

If a map is provided to the method, only the permissions with truthy values will be requested.

This method returns a promise that will resolve when the user accepts or rejects the request, or if the permissions were previously rejected. The promise resolves to the state of the permissions after the request has been completed.

**Parameters:**

| Name        | Type  | Required | Description            |
| ----------- | ----- | -------- | ---------------------- |
| permissions | array | No       | alert, badge, or sound |

***

### `abandonPermissions()`[​](#abandonpermissions "Direct link to abandonpermissions")

tsx

```
static abandonPermissions();
```

Unregister for all remote notifications received via Apple Push Notification service.

You should call this method in rare circumstances only, such as when a new version of the app removes support for all types of remote notifications. Users can temporarily prevent apps from receiving remote notifications through the Settings app. Apps unregistered through this method can always re-register.

***

### `checkPermissions()`[​](#checkpermissions "Direct link to checkpermissions")

tsx

```
static checkPermissions(
  callback: (permissions: PushNotificationPermissions) => void,
);
```

Check which push permissions are currently enabled.

**Parameters:**

| Name     | Type     | Required | Description |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | ----------- |
| callback | function | Yes      | See below.  |

`callback` will be invoked with a `permissions` object:

* `alert: boolean`
* `badge: boolean`
* `sound: boolean`

***

### `getInitialNotification()`[​](#getinitialnotification "Direct link to getinitialnotification")

tsx

```
static getInitialNotification(): Promise<PushNotification | null>;
```

This method returns a promise. If the app was launched by a push notification, this promise resolves to an object of type `PushNotificationIOS` for the notification that was tapped. Otherwise, it resolves to `null`.

***

### `getAuthorizationStatus()`[​](#getauthorizationstatus "Direct link to getauthorizationstatus")

tsx

```
static getAuthorizationStatus(): Promise<number>;
```

This method returns a promise that resolves to the current notification authorization status. See [UNAuthorizationStatus](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unauthorizationstatus?language=objc) for possible values.

***

### `finish()`[​](#finish "Direct link to finish")

tsx

```
finish(result: string);
```

This method is available for remote notifications that have been received via [`application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate/1623013-application?language=objc). However, this is superseded by `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate` and will no longer be invoked if both `application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler:` and the newer handlers from `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate` are implemented.

If for some reason you're still relying on `application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler:`, you'll need to set up event handling on the iOS side:

objectivec

```
- (void)           application:(UIApplication *)application
  didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)userInfo
        fetchCompletionHandler:(void (^)(UIBackgroundFetchResult result))handler
{
  [RCTPushNotificationManager didReceiveRemoteNotification:userInfo fetchCompletionHandler:handler];
}
```

Call `finish()` to execute the native completion handlers once you're done handling the notification on the JS side. When calling this block, pass in the fetch result value that best describes the results of your operation. For a list of possible values, see `PushNotificationIOS.FetchResult`.

If you're using `application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler:`, you *must* call this handler and should do so as soon as possible. See the [official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate/1623013-application?language=objc) for more details.
