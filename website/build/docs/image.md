# Image

A React component for displaying different types of images, including network images, static resources, temporary local images, and images from local disk, such as the camera roll.

This example shows fetching and displaying an image from local storage as well as one from network and even from data provided in the `'data:'` uri scheme.

note

For network and data images, you will need to manually specify the dimensions of your image!

## Examples[​](#examples "Direct link to Examples")

You can also add `style` to an image:

## GIF and WebP support on Android[​](#gif-and-webp-support-on-android "Direct link to GIF and WebP support on Android")

When building your own native code, GIF and WebP are not supported by default on Android.

You will need to add some optional modules in `android/app/build.gradle`, depending on the needs of your app.

groovy

```
dependencies {
  // If your app supports Android versions before Ice Cream Sandwich (API level 14)
  implementation 'com.facebook.fresco:animated-base-support:1.3.0'

  // For animated GIF support
  implementation 'com.facebook.fresco:animated-gif:3.6.0'

  // For WebP support, including animated WebP
  implementation 'com.facebook.fresco:animated-webp:3.6.0'
  implementation 'com.facebook.fresco:webpsupport:3.6.0'

  // For WebP support, without animations
  implementation 'com.facebook.fresco:webpsupport:3.6.0'
}
```

note

***

### `resizeMethod`Android[​](#resizemethod-android "Direct link to resizemethod-android")

The mechanism that should be used to resize the image when the image's dimensions differ from the image view's dimensions. Defaults to `auto`.

* `auto`: Use heuristics to pick between `resize` and `scale`.

* `resize`: A software operation which changes the encoded image in memory before it gets decoded. This should be used instead of `scale` when the image is much larger than the view.

* `scale`: The image gets drawn downscaled or upscaled. Compared to `resize`, `scale` is faster (usually hardware accelerated) and produces higher quality images. This should be used if the image is smaller than the view. It should also be used if the image is slightly bigger than the view.

* `none`: No sampling is performed and the image is displayed in its full resolution. This should only be used in rare circumstances because it is considered unsafe as Android will throw a runtime exception when trying to render images that consume too much memory.

More details about `resize` and `scale` can be found at <https://frescolib.org/docs/resizing>.

| Type                                            | Default  |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| enum(`'auto'`, `'resize'`, `'scale'`, `'none'`) | `'auto'` |

***

### `resizeMode`[​](#resizemode "Direct link to resizemode")

Determines how to resize the image when the frame doesn't match the raw image dimensions. Defaults to `cover`.

* `cover`: Scale the image uniformly (maintain the image's aspect ratio) so that

  * both dimensions (width and height) of the image will be equal to or larger than the corresponding dimension of the view (minus padding)
  * at least one dimension of the scaled image will be equal to the corresponding dimension of the view (minus padding)

* `contain`: Scale the image uniformly (maintain the image's aspect ratio) so that both dimensions (width and height) of the image will be equal to or less than the corresponding dimension of the view (minus padding).

* `stretch`: Scale width and height independently, This may change the aspect ratio of the src.

* `repeat`: Repeat the image to cover the frame of the view. The image will keep its size and aspect ratio, unless it is larger than the view, in which case it will be scaled down uniformly so that it is contained in the view.

* `center`: Center the image in the view along both dimensions. If the image is larger than the view, scale it down uniformly so that it is contained in the view.

| Type                                                              | Default   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| enum(`'cover'`, `'contain'`, `'stretch'`, `'repeat'`, `'center'`) | `'cover'` |

***

### `resizeMultiplier`Android[​](#resizemultiplier-android "Direct link to resizemultiplier-android")

When the `resizeMethod` is set to `resize`, the destination dimensions are multiplied by this value. The `scale` method is used to perform the remainder of the resize. A default of `1.0` means the bitmap size is designed to fit the destination dimensions. A multiplier greater than `1.0` will set the resize options larger than that of the destination dimensions, and the resulting bitmap will be scaled down from the hardware size. Defaults to `1.0`.

This prop is most useful in cases where the destination dimensions are quite small and the source image is significantly larger. The `resize` resize method performs downsampling and significant image quality is lost between the source and destination image sizes, often resulting in a blurry image. By using a multiplier, the decoded image is slightly larger than the target size but smaller than the source image (if the source image is large enough). This allows aliasing artifacts to produce faux quality through scaling operations on the multiplied image.

If you have a source image with dimensions 200x200 and destination dimensions of 24x24, a resizeMultiplier of `2.0` will tell Fresco to downsample the image to 48x48. Fresco picks the closest power of 2 (so, 50x50) and decodes the image into a bitmap of that size. Without the multiplier, the closest power of 2 would be 25x25. The resultant image is scaled down by the system.

| Type   | Default |
| ------ | ------- |
| number | `1.0`   |

***

### `source`[​](#source "Direct link to source")

The image source (either a remote URL or a local file resource).

This prop can also contain several remote URLs, specified together with their width and height and potentially with scale/other URI arguments. The native side will then choose the best `uri` to display based on the measured size of the image container. A `cache` property can be added to control how networked request interacts with the local cache. (For more information see [Cache Control for Images](/docs/images.md#cache-control)).

The currently supported formats are `png`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `bmp`, `gif`, `webp`, `psd` (iOS only). In addition, iOS supports several RAW image formats. Refer to Apple's documentation for the current list of supported camera models (for iOS 12, see <https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT208967>).

Please note that the `webp` format is supported on iOS **only** when bundled with the JavaScript code.

| ----------------------------------------- |
| [ImageSource](/docs/image.md#imagesource) |

***

### `src`[​](#src "Direct link to src")

A string representing the remote URL of the image. This prop has precedence over `source` prop.

**Example:** `src={'https://reactnative.dev/img/tiny_logo.png'}`

| Type   |
| ------ |
| string |

***

### `srcSet`[​](#srcset "Direct link to srcset")

A string representing comma separated list of possible candidate image source. Each image source contains a URL of an image and a pixel density descriptor. If no descriptor is specified, it defaults to descriptor of `1x`.

If `srcSet` does not contain a `1x` descriptor, the value in `src` is used as image source with `1x` descriptor (if provided).

This prop has precedence over both the `src` and `source` props.

**Example:** `srcSet={'https://reactnative.dev/img/tiny_logo.png 1x, https://reactnative.dev/img/header_logo.svg 2x'}`

| Type   |
| ------ |
| string |

## Methods[​](#methods "Direct link to Methods")

### `abortPrefetch()`Android[​](#abortprefetch-android "Direct link to abortprefetch-android")

tsx

```
static abortPrefetch(requestId: number);
```

Abort prefetch request.

**Parameters:**

### `getSize()`[​](#getsize "Direct link to getsize")

tsx

```
static getSize(uri: string): Promise<{width: number, height: number}>;
```

Retrieve the width and height (in pixels) of an image prior to displaying it. This method can fail if the image cannot be found, or fails to download.

In order to retrieve the image dimensions, the image may first need to be loaded or downloaded, after which it will be cached. This means that in principle you could use this method to preload images, however it is not optimized for that purpose, and may in future be implemented in a way that does not fully load/download the image data. A proper, supported way to preload images will be provided as a separate API.

**Parameters:**

| Name        | Type   | Description                |
| ----------- | ------ | -------------------------- |
| uriRequired | string | The location of the image. |

***

### `getSizeWithHeaders()`[​](#getsizewithheaders "Direct link to getsizewithheaders")

tsx

```
static getSizeWithHeaders(
  uri: string,
  headers: {[index: string]: string}
): Promise<{width: number, height: number}>;
```

Retrieve the width and height (in pixels) of an image prior to displaying it with the ability to provide the headers for the request. This method can fail if the image cannot be found, or fails to download. It also does not work for static image resources.

In order to retrieve the image dimensions, the image may first need to be loaded or downloaded, after which it will be cached. This means that in principle you could use this method to preload images, however it is not optimized for that purpose, and may in future be implemented in a way that does not fully load/download the image data. A proper, supported way to preload images will be provided as a separate API.
