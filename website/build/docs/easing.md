# Easing

The `Easing` module implements common easing functions. This module is used by [`Animated.timing()`](/docs/animated.md#timing) to convey physically believable motion in animations.

You can find a visualization of some common easing functions at <https://easings.net/>

### Predefined animations[​](#predefined-animations "Direct link to Predefined animations")

The `Easing` module provides several predefined animations through the following methods:

* [`back`](/docs/easing.md#back) provides a basic animation where the object goes slightly back before moving forward
* [`bounce`](/docs/easing.md#bounce) provides a bouncing animation
* [`ease`](/docs/easing.md#ease) provides a basic inertial animation
* [`elastic`](/docs/easing.md#elastic) provides a basic spring interaction

### Standard functions[​](#standard-functions "Direct link to Standard functions")

Three standard easing functions are provided:

* [`linear`](/docs/easing.md#linear)
* [`quad`](/docs/easing.md#quad)
* [`cubic`](/docs/easing.md#cubic)

The [`poly`](/docs/easing.md#poly) function can be used to implement quartic, quintic, and other higher power functions.

### Additional functions[​](#additional-functions "Direct link to Additional functions")

Additional mathematical functions are provided by the following methods:

* [`bezier`](/docs/easing.md#bezier) provides a cubic bezier curve
* [`circle`](/docs/easing.md#circle) provides a circular function
* [`sin`](/docs/easing.md#sin) provides a sinusoidal function
* [`exp`](/docs/easing.md#exp) provides an exponential function

The following helpers are used to modify other easing functions.

* [`in`](/docs/easing.md#in) runs an easing function forwards
* [`inOut`](/docs/easing.md#inout) makes any easing function symmetrical
* [`out`](/docs/easing.md#out) runs an easing function backwards

# Reference

## Methods[​](#methods "Direct link to Methods")

### `step0()`[​](#step0 "Direct link to step0")

tsx

```
static step0(n: number);
```

A stepping function, returns 1 for any positive value of `n`.

***

### `step1()`[​](#step1 "Direct link to step1")

tsx

```
static step1(n: number);
```

A stepping function, returns 1 if `n` is greater than or equal to 1.

***

### `linear()`[​](#linear "Direct link to linear")

tsx

```
static linear(t: number);
```

A linear function, `f(t) = t`. Position correlates to elapsed time one to one.

<https://cubic-bezier.com/#0,0,1,1>

***

### `ease()`[​](#ease "Direct link to ease")

tsx

```
static ease(t: number);
```

A basic inertial interaction, similar to an object slowly accelerating to speed.

<https://cubic-bezier.com/#.42,0,1,1>

***

### `quad()`[​](#quad "Direct link to quad")

tsx

```
static quad(t: number);
```

A quadratic function, `f(t) = t * t`. Position equals the square of elapsed time.

<https://easings.net/#easeInQuad>

***

### `cubic()`[​](#cubic "Direct link to cubic")

tsx

```
static cubic(t: number);
```

A cubic function, `f(t) = t * t * t`. Position equals the cube of elapsed time.

<https://easings.net/#easeInCubic>

***

### `poly()`[​](#poly "Direct link to poly")

tsx

```
static poly(n: number);
```

A power function. Position is equal to the Nth power of elapsed time.

n = 4: <https://easings.net/#easeInQuart> n = 5: <https://easings.net/#easeInQuint>

***

### `sin()`[​](#sin "Direct link to sin")

tsx

```
static sin(t: number);
```

A sinusoidal function.

<https://easings.net/#easeInSine>

***

### `circle()`[​](#circle "Direct link to circle")

tsx

```
static circle(t: number);
```

A circular function.

<https://easings.net/#easeInCirc>

***

### `exp()`[​](#exp "Direct link to exp")

tsx

```
static exp(t: number);
```

An exponential function.

<https://easings.net/#easeInExpo>

***

### `elastic()`[​](#elastic "Direct link to elastic")

tsx

```
static elastic(bounciness: number);
```

A basic elastic interaction, similar to a spring oscillating back and forth.

Default bounciness is 1, which overshoots a little bit once. 0 bounciness doesn't overshoot at all, and bounciness of N > 1 will overshoot about N times.

<https://easings.net/#easeInElastic>

***

### `back()`[​](#back "Direct link to back")

tsx

```
static back(s)
```

Use with `Animated.parallel()` to create a basic effect where the object animates back slightly as the animation starts.

***

### `bounce()`[​](#bounce "Direct link to bounce")

tsx

```
static bounce(t: number);
```

Provides a basic bouncing effect.

<https://easings.net/#easeInBounce>

***

### `bezier()`[​](#bezier "Direct link to bezier")

tsx

```
static bezier(x1: number, y1: number, x2: number, y2: number);
```

Provides a cubic bezier curve, equivalent to CSS Transitions' `transition-timing-function`.

A useful tool to visualize cubic bezier curves can be found at <https://cubic-bezier.com/>

***

### `in()`[​](#in "Direct link to in")

tsx

```
static in(easing: number);
```

Runs an easing function forwards.

***

### `out()`[​](#out "Direct link to out")

tsx

```
static out(easing: number);
```

Runs an easing function backwards.

***

### `inOut()`[​](#inout "Direct link to inout")

tsx

```
static inOut(easing: number);
```

Makes any easing function symmetrical. The easing function will run forwards for half of the duration, then backwards for the rest of the duration.
