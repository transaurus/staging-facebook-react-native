# Vibration

Vibrates the device.

## Example[​](#example "Direct link to Example")

info

Android apps should request the `android.permission.VIBRATE` permission by adding `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.VIBRATE"/>` to `AndroidManifest.xml`.

note

The Vibration API is implemented as a `AudioServicesPlaySystemSound(kSystemSoundID_Vibrate)` call on iOS.

***

# Reference

## Methods[​](#methods "Direct link to Methods")

### `cancel()`[​](#cancel "Direct link to cancel")

tsx

```
static cancel();
```

Call this to stop vibrating after having invoked `vibrate()` with repetition enabled.

***

### `vibrate()`[​](#vibrate "Direct link to vibrate")

tsx

```
static vibrate(
  pattern?: number | number[],
  repeat?: boolean
);
```

Triggers a vibration with a fixed duration.

**On Android,** the vibration duration defaults to 400 milliseconds, and an arbitrary vibration duration can be specified by passing a number as the value for the `pattern` argument. **On iOS,** the vibration duration is fixed at roughly 400 milliseconds.

The `vibrate()` method can take a `pattern` argument with an array of numbers that represent time in milliseconds. You may set `repeat` to true to run through the vibration pattern in a loop until `cancel()` is called.

**On Android,** the odd indices of the `pattern` array represent the vibration duration, while the even ones represent the separation time. **On iOS,** the numbers in the `pattern` array represent the separation time, as the vibration duration is fixed.

**Parameters:**
