## Methods[​](#methods "Direct link to Methods")

### `addListener()`[​](#addlistener "Direct link to addlistener")

tsx

```
static addListener: (
  eventType: KeyboardEventName,
  listener: KeyboardEventListener,
) => EmitterSubscription;
```

The `addListener` function connects a JavaScript function to an identified native keyboard notification event.

This function then returns the reference to the listener.

**Parameters:**

| Name              | Type     | Description                                                                    |
| ----------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| eventNameRequired | string   | The string that identifies the event you're listening for. See the list below. |
| callbackRequired  | function | The function to be called when the event fires                                 |

**`eventName`**

This can be any of the following:

* `keyboardWillShow`
* `keyboardDidShow`
* `keyboardWillHide`
* `keyboardDidHide`
* `keyboardWillChangeFrame`
* `keyboardDidChangeFrame`

note

Only `keyboardDidShow` and `keyboardDidHide` events are available on Android. The events will not be fired when using Android 10 or below if your activity has `android:windowSoftInputMode` set to `adjustResize` or `adjustNothing`.
